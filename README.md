# Portfolio Playground

This project is dedicated to creating a personal portfolio/resume web app, whilst learing and playing around with some cool tech.

## Objectives

The main objective is to keep myself active in the OSS space and to have a place where I can freely try new and old technology without consequence.

Other than that:
- Having a cool website definitelly doesn't hurt;
- Foster good programming habits;
- Learn new and interesting patterns;
- Practice writing with a blog-like section.

## Expectations (to self)

(so that I don't leave this hanging one week in)

1. Do at least something every week;
2. Start small and build up;
3. Don't overengineer when not necessary;
4. Do whatever as long as you are doing something;
5. Try to document as you go;
6. Try to contribute to your dependencies as much as possible.
